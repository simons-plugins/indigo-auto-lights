Utility Functions - Auto Lights Plugin

This module provides utility functions for device control and state verification:

- Device control with brief settle-and-confirm for state verification
- State confirmation to ensure devices reach target states
- Brightness and on/off control for various device types (dimmers, relays, SenseME fans)
- Logging for device control operations

The functions in this module handle low-level device interaction and provide
a consistent interface for controlling different types of Indigo devices.

# Brightness confirmation tolerance, in percentage points.
#
# Device plugins that carry level in a native non-percentage range scale a
# commanded percentage out and back, and several truncate in both directions
# (zigbee2mqtt: 30% -> int(76.5)=76 -> int(29.8)=29). Confirming on exact
# equality then never succeeds for 95 of the 101 percentages, so healthy
# hardware gets suppressed for the life of the lighting period. A floor of 1
# absorbs a 0-254 or 0-99 round trip and is smaller than any meaningful
# brightness step, so genuine failures still fail.
#
# 2026-08-24, live jarvis logs: a flat band of 1 was still too tight. Real
# zigbee2mqtt dimmers were reporting back several points low of a commanded
# level — (30, 28), (50, 45..48) — and each miss locked the zone out of
# automation. The gap scales with the target (10->1, 30->2, 50->2..5), so a
# flat number can't fit it; the fix is proportional, floored at the same 1.
# The worst offender was a z2m *group* device (a "Zigbee Group Dimmer"
# aggregating several physical lamps): its reported brightness derives from
# members that settle slightly differently, so the same commanded level read
# back 48, 47 or 45 on different cycles — not deterministic quantization, and
# not mid-fade sampling (the comparison runs ~8ms after the target is
# computed, against the previous cycle's settled value). The slop was always
# downward; two genuine external changes in the same logs (40->49, 30->49)
# were both upward and must still lock the zone.
