Zone Module - Auto Lights Plugin

This module implements the Zone class, which represents a logical grouping of lights
with shared automation rules. Zones are the core abstraction for automatic lighting
control, managing:

- Device control (on/off/brightness) based on presence and luminance
- Zone locking to prevent automation when users manually control lights
- Lighting periods for time-based control (on/off times, brightness limits)
- Brightness planning using luminance sensors
- State synchronization with Indigo devices

Each zone can have:
- Multiple light devices (dimmers, relays, or other controllable devices)
- Presence sensors to detect occupancy
- Luminance sensors for ambient light-aware brightness adjustment
- Lock exclusion devices that prevent zone locking when manually controlled
- Global behavior variable mappings for external automation control

Zones use thread-safe locking mechanisms to coordinate state changes and prevent
race conditions during device updates.

      - Calculate target brightness using LightingPeriod rules.
      - Enforce and extend a lock state to avoid rapid toggles.
      - Sync both configuration and runtime state definitions and values to an Indigo zone device.

    Attributes:
        name (str): Human-readable name of the zone.
        on_lights_dev_ids (List[int]): IDs of devices to turn on.

        The rule is a transition on the device the event is about: the state
        BEFORE the change (Indigo's ``origDev``) was at target and the state
        AFTER the change is not. Nothing else is consulted — no live re-read
        of the device, and no scan of the other devices in the zone — so a
        concurrent ``process_zone`` that reverts the change before this
        callback looks cannot erase the evidence, which is the snapshot pair
        Indigo handed us.

        Why Auto Lights' own writes cannot satisfy it: the plugin only ever
        commands a device that is NOT at target
        (``save_brightness_changes`` skips at-target devices and
        ``send_to_indigo`` pre-checks again), so every echo of a command —
        first report, intermediate ramp step, final value, late straggler —
        has an off-target previous state. AND, because a re-plan between the
        command and its echo can put the target back onto the device's
        pre-command state, a transition whose STARTING point is a state we
        commanded the device away from within ``COMMAND_ECHO_WINDOW_SECONDS``
        is excused even when it does read as at-target → off-target. Each
        recorded command excuses one such transition and is then consumed.

        This method has a side effect: when it returns True it sets
        ``self.locked``. It never clears a lock.

        Two earlier implementations of this rule are ruled out by the tests:
        the whole-zone LIVE read (#15, #10) and the dropped ``checked_out``
        early return (test M6 in ``tests/test_lock_transition_rule.py``).
