"""Tests for the intersection of zone locks and per-device failure suppression.

These cover scenarios that were not exercised by either the locking tests
(test_lock_extension.py, test_lock_on_device_change.py) or the suppression
tests (test_device_failure_tracking.py) in isolation. The interesting cases
all live where the two systems meet.
